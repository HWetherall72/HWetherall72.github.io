                <p>I am a game programmer/designer, I am currently a 3rd year Student at Falmouth University in the Games Academy.
                    During my time here I have been able to experiment with many different programming languages and game engines. 
                    I have also explored data science and robotics and have utilised LaTeX. I have the most experience with C# and Unity
                    but also have experience with C++ and blueprints in Unreal Engine 5. My experience also extends to practices like
                    using Agile and version control.

                <h3>Unity</h3>
                <p>  
                    Within my time at Falmouth University I have made several projects within Unity. My personal projects within unity have been clicker style games. 
                    I have also made several group games which have been 3D beat 'em up within a pub brawl setting, action adventure inspired by the ferry man of the River Styx 
                    and puzzle/simulator set in a dystopian capitalistic future where not even your dreams are safe from the control of others.

                <h3>Unreal Engine 5</h3>
                <p>
                    During my time at Falmouth University I have done a couple projects within Unreal Engine 5. For my first project I made a fps boss fight 
                    based on the Shiv boss fight from Borderlands 3. For my second project I made a face paced, parkour, fps level taking inpiration from 
                    UltraKill, using the Lyra Sample Game as a base. For both of my projects I mainly used Blueprints but still used C++ for some of the features.
